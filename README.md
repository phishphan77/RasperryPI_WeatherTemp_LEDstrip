Raspberry Pi Weather Temp LED Strip

Simple python script that automatically adjusts the color and brightness of an RBG LED strip based on the current temperature outside at a certain location.

Uses OpenWeatherMap API for current weather data.

Must connect LED strip to Raspberry PI GPIO pins using MOFSETs.  Circuit diagram will be added at some point.
